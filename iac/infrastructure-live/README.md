## Versioning for IAC

##### We are using [TGSwitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/tgswitch) and [TFEnv](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/568) to switch Terraform and Terragrunt versions based on a version file (`.terragrunt-version` for [TGSwitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/tgswitch) and `.terraform-version` for [TFEnv](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/568)) located in the `infrastructure-live folder` 

#### Note:
##### To use [TGSwitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/tgswitch) and [TFEnv](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/568), you need to uninstall your current Terraform and Terragrunt versions. It will be installed automatically.
